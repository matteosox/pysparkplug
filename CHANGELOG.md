# Changelog

All notable changes for `pysparkplug` will be documented in this file.
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) and [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/).

## 0.2.0 (2023-08-23)

### Added
- `SINGLE_LEVEL_WILDCARD` and `MULTI_LEVEL_WILDCARD` wildcards for subscribing to multiple MQTT topics, conveniently typed to pass type checking

### Changed
- Refactored how dependencies are entered into the package's metadata, using `hatch-requirements-txt` referencing `requirements/requirements.txt`

### Removed
- Removed `Topic.to_string()`, since users should just use `str(topic)`.

### Fixed
- Explicitly making `MetricValue` available from the top-level package, resolving any type annotation issues.
- Fixed bug with implementation of `StrEnum` that resulted in enums not converting correctly to string. This resulted in topics not rendering to string correctly, since the `message_type` attribute was `MessageType`, an instance of `StrEnum`.
- Fixed bug with topic component validation, which was using the wrong wildcard constants `"#*"` instead of the correct `"#+"`.
